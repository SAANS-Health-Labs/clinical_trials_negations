How to detect negations in clinical text


In this notebook, I used negex to detect negated entities. Negex was developed in early 2000', but it continues to be the leading package for negation detection. It was espcially developed to handle clinical text. We compare negex with stanza by using the spacy_stanza wrapper. Together, they will identify medical entities, and tell us whether each entity is negated.
